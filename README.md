## Technologies Used

### Next.js Ã— Contentful

To build this platform, I use Next.js in combination with Contentful, a highly extensible headless CMS which allows me to manage content in a flexible and dynamic way.

### Figma for UI Design

I create UI design using Figma to translate ideas into visuals.
